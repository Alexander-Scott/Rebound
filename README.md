Unity mobile game

How to play:
Flick lots of balls at blocks around the edge of the screen. You gain at point for every block you hit that has the same colour as
the ball. If the ball you flick hits a block with a different colour it's game over.

Thinking Points:
- When you flick a ball the next ball smoothly animates from under the screen to the ball point.
